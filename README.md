# count_citation
This is a clone from the repo: https://github.com/ckreibich/scholar.py.git
A wrapper collect_from_bibtex.py is added to parse the bibtex file which contains a collection of articles. Each article will be searched on Google Scholar using the scholar.py to extract the number of citations. The final results will be sorted base on the number of citations and written to a csv file.
